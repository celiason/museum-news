i'm having trouble getting relevant texts

i ask about gorillas and none of the semantic search matches are about gorillas.
ha

trying smaller chunk size

the text matching is not doing well AT ALL

there aren't spaces between words with pypdf2
..pymupdf2 for llm looks better, but when i took a closer look i see that the multicolumns are not found and all the text runs together in a horizontal line (so it makes zero sense.)

FUCK YES!!!
pymupdf worked SO WELL!!!!!
    it captures the columns (pymupdf4llm DOES NOT)
    it maintains spaces between words (pypdf2 DOES NOT)



TODO

- get metadata from the files (year, title, etc.)
- might be able to just do a REGEX.. ? first line, etc.
